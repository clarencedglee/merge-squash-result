# merge-squash-result

Hello there!

Have you ever wondered
What happens when you merge master
Into your working branch
Then squash and merge your working branch
Back into master?

Does the merge commit also get squashed
Leaving you with just the one tidy squash commit?

A change from working-a
A change from working-b

Now we know!

The merge commit remained after the squash and merge.
